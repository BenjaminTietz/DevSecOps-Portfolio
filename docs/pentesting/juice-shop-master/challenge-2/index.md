# Title

Clear and descriptive title of the penetration test or challenge.

## Abstract

A short abstract describing the performed measures, the scope of the test, and the overall objective.  
This section provides a quick overview of what was tested and why.

## Preparation Documentation

### Identified Vulnerability / Vulnerabilities and Risk Assessment

- Description of the identified security vulnerability or vulnerabilities
- Risk assessment (e.g. low, medium, high, critical)
- Potential impact if the vulnerability is exploited

### Known Exploits

- List of known exploits related to the identified vulnerability
- References (CVE IDs, exploit databases, public advisories)

### Execution of the Penetration Test

- Description of how the actual penetration test was performed
- Tools and techniques used
- Assumptions and constraints during testing

## Results Documentation

### Accessible Information

- What kind of information was accessible?
- Was sensitive data exposed?
- Were credentials, configuration files, or internal data reachable?

### Exploitation Depth

- To what extent could the vulnerability be exploited?
- Could it be used as an entry point to discover additional weaknesses?
- Was lateral movement or privilege escalation possible?

### Discovery Process

- How were the vulnerabilities discovered?
- Manual testing, automated scanning, or a combination of both?

### Exploitation Process

- How were the vulnerabilities exploited?
- Step-by-step explanation (high level, no unnecessary weaponization)

### Outcome

- What was the final result of the exploitation?
- What level of access was achieved?
- What systems or data were affected?

## Mitigation Measures

- Possible measures to close or mitigate the identified vulnerabilities
- Configuration changes, patches, or architectural improvements

## Recommendations and Prioritization

- Security recommendations based on risk and impact
- Prioritization of vulnerabilities (what should be fixed first and why)
